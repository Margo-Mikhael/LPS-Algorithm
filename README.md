**Project Name:** Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS) Calculation

**Description:**  
This C++ project implements the dynamic programming approach to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string. The algorithm fills up a table (`L`) to store results of subproblems and uses them to determine the length of the longest palindromic subsequence efficiently. This project serves as a useful resource for understanding dynamic programming and algorithmic problem-solving techniques in C++.
